## How to run?
1. Move to ```<project-dir>```, create virtual environment and then activate it as

```sh
$ cd <project-dir>
$ virtualenv .environment
$ source .environment/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
>Note: Step-1 is optional but recommended.

2. Add project to ```PYTHONPATH``` as 

```sh 
$ export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:." # . corresponds to current directory(project-dir)
```

> If you are using PyCharm then it can be done under `run configuration`.
